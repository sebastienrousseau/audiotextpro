"""
This module serves as the main entry point for utilizing the AssemblyAI transcription service.

The script performs the following operations sequentially:
1. Uploads an audio file to AssemblyAI.
2. Requests a transcript of the uploaded audio file.
3. Processes and saves the resulting transcript.

Example usage:
    Ensure that API_TOKEN and FILENAME are set correctly, then run:
    $ python main.py

Note: Sensitive information like API tokens should typically be stored securely
and not hard-coded into scripts.
