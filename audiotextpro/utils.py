This module provides utility functions used throughout the project.
These include [functionality of the module, e.g., file I/O, data processing].

Example:
    Describe how to use module, if applicable.

Functions:
    * read_file - Reads a file in chunks.
    * another_function - [Description of another function].

    Generator function to read a file in chunks.

    Args:
        file_to_read (str): Path to the file to read.
        chunk_size (int, optional): Size of chunks to read in bytes.
        Defaults to 5 MB.

    Yields:
        bytes: Chunks of file contents.
